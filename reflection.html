                <p>In Intro Software Technology we learned about a lot of things. Like the basic functions of a computer and all the pieces of it. We did lots of CodeHS to learn about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and programming with Karel. We set up VM's and made websites using HTML. </p>
                <p>We set up a VM by downloading an ubuntu flavor and we set it up. We made a website using HTML and CSS. We used VS code in our VM's to make the website.</p>
                <p>We learned about the parts of a PC. We learned about the internal components, peripheral devices, software vs. hardware, and the future of computing.  </p>
                <p>We did CodeHS to learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We learned how to make lists, images, tables, to use classes, and using RGB to create colors. We used all of these to make our previous website and this website.</p>
