                <p>This website talks about some of the coding languages and talks about this course, Intro to Software Technology. This class was very fun! We did a lot of things in this class like learning to count in Binary, use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We even learned about all the pieces that make up a computer.</p>
                <p>The Programming Languages page has 4 coding languages. Python, Java, C, and JavaScript. It has their creators and how they are mainly used.</p>
                <p>The Reflection page reflects on 3 different topics that I learned about and enjoyed. Also reflecting on the course overall. </p>
